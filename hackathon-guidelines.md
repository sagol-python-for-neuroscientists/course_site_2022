# Hackathon Guidelines

* The hackathon will take place from the morning of Wednesday, July 6th, until Thursday night.
* There will be a kick-off meeting Wednesday morning at 9:00.
* A list of the available projects will be published on Tuesday, June 21st.
* Students will self-assign to groups a send Gal and me a list of three projects (by order of preference) by Wednesday, June 29th at 16:00.
* Project assignments will be published by Thursday, June 30th (EOD).
* Groups working on a particular dataset will be granted access to the data by the day before the hackathon, and will meet with their assigned mentor either on the day before or the morning of the hackathon, dependeing on the mentors' and group members' availability.
* Each group will schedule a presentation with Gal and me on Monday, July 5th, to showcase their work.
* The projects are expected to be the result of two days' work, and will be graded accordingly. The rationale for scheduling the presentations on Monday is to give you the full two days for coding and not force you to have to prepare the presentation during the weekend.

  * Code quality (50%)
    * Design patterns and coding paradigms
    * PEP8
